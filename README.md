we integrate Generative AI with anomaly detection to build a smart compliance monitoring system for financial institutions. Our solution targets key regulatory frameworks such as TCPA, Regulation Z, FCRA, FDCPA, and others. GenAI is used to interpret and summarize complex regulatory texts and customer communications, while anomaly detection algorithms flag unusual transaction patterns and behavioral deviations that may signal potential compliance breaches. This dual approach enhances early detection of risks, ensures proactive regulatory adherence, and reduces the burden of manual compliance checks.
