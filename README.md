introduces a novel GenAI-powered approach to fraud analytics by creating Synthetic Fraudster Personasâ€”AI-generated profiles that mimic real-world fraud tactics, behavioral patterns, and communication styles. These personas are used to proactively simulate fraud attacks across digital channels (e.g., chat, transactions, calls) to stress-test fraud detection systems. By running continuous, AI-driven threat simulations, organizations can uncover hidden vulnerabilities, adapt faster to evolving fraud techniques, and significantly enhance their fraud prevention capabilities. This shift from reactive to offensive fraud analytics opens a new frontier in proactive risk defense.


we integrate Generative AI with anomaly detection to build a smart compliance monitoring system for financial institutions. Our solution targets key regulatory frameworks such as TCPA, Regulation Z, FCRA, FDCPA, and others. GenAI is used to interpret and summarize complex regulatory texts and customer communications, while anomaly detection algorithms flag unusual transaction patterns and behavioral deviations that may signal potential compliance breaches. This dual approach enhances early detection of risks, ensures proactive regulatory adherence, and reduces the burden of manual compliance checks.
